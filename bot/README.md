# 🐍 Habbo Clientless Python Bot (Flash/Air Protocol)

A fully functional, **headless (clientless)** automation framework for Habbo Hotel. This project implements the complete Flash/Air binary protocol from scratch in Python. It runs entirely via TCP sockets—**no browser, no Flash, and no AIR client required.**

Because it is clientless, you can run **100+ bots** on a single low-end VPS.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
Requires Python 3.10 or higher.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devlyresh/Habbo-Bot.git
cd Habbo-Bot
pip install pycryptodome requests PySocks
```

Inside the folder you'll see example.py file. Check that.


### 2. Configuration (Cookies)
To log in, the bot needs your session cookies.
1.  Login to Habbo on your browser.
2.  Press `F12` (Dev Tools) -> **Network**.
3.  Click PLAY button. Filter for `clientnative`.
4.  Click the request named `url`.
5.  Copy `session.id` and `browser_token` from **Request Headers**.

Or you can use some extensions like Cookie Editor to grab cookies.


Open `example.py` and paste them:
```python
MY_COOKIES = [
    {"name": "session.id", "value": "YOUR_SESSION_ID"},
    {"name": "browser_token", "value": "YOUR_BROWSER_TOKEN"}
]
```
### 3. Run

```Bash
python example.py
```

If your terminal is like this:


---
```bash
[06:18:00] [BOT] Socket connected.
[06:18:01] [BOT] Waiting for login flow...
[06:18:01] [BOT] AUTHENTICATION OK!
[06:18:01] [BOT] ✅ Connected to Habbo Game Server!
[06:18:01] [BOT] Joining Room ID: 80257391...
[06:18:01] [BOT] 🏠 Successfully entered the room!
[06:18:01] [BOT] Walking to (5, 5)...
[06:18:03] [BOT] Shouting message...
[06:18:05] [BOT] Dancing...
[06:18:08] [BOT] Starting Random Walk...
```

then it means you successfully connected.

## 🌍 Changing Servers
By default, this is set to **US (.com)**. To change to Turkey, Brazil, or Spain:

1.  **Edit `constants.py`:**
    ```python
    HABBO_HOST = "game-tr.habbo.com" # Turkey
    # HABBO_HOST = "game-br.habbo.com" # Brazil
    ```
2.  **Edit `sso_manager.py`:**
    ```python
    BASE_HEADERS = {
        'origin': 'https://www.habbo.com.tr',
        'referer': 'https://www.habbo.com.tr/',
        # ...
    }
    ```
